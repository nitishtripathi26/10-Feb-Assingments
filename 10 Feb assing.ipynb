    "The mode parameter is optional and if not specified, the file is opened in read-only mode by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the different modes of opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-'r' - Read mode: This is the default mode of opening a file. The file is opened in read-only mode, and the file pointer\n",
    "is placed at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-'w' - Write mode: In this mode, the file is opened in write mode, and the file pointer is placed at the beginning \n",
    "of the file. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-'a' - Append mode: In this mode, the file is opened in append mode, and the file pointer is placed at the end of the file.\n",
    "If the file already exists, new data is appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-'x' - Exclusive mode: In this mode, the file is opened in exclusive mode, and a new file is created. If the file already \n",
    "exists, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-'b' - Binary mode: In this mode, the file is opened in binary mode, which is used for reading and writing binary data\n",
    "such as images or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "6-'t' - Text mode: In this mode, the file is opened in text mode, which is used for reading and writing text data.\n",
